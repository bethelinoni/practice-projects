# Frontend Challenges ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions to different Frontend Mentor and other practice challenges.  
Iâ€™m using this space to build my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while documenting my progress.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
Each challenge has its own folder inside the repo:


Inside each challenge folder, youâ€™ll find:
- index.html(main HTML file)  
- style.css(styling)
- script.js(JavaScript file if needed)
- images/(images used in the project in an 'images' folder)
